        <h2>whoami</h2>
        <p>
            My name is Valdas. I'm a software developer, and I'm currently working at Nord Security as a malware dataset
            curator.
            Nowadays, I mostly write bugs for a living, whether it's for fun or to make money.
        </p>
        <h2>what the heck is a dataset curator</h2>
        <p>
            In theory, I'm responsible for the quality of a dataset. To be more specific,
            I use whatever means necessary to build and grow our data(set), whether it would be scraping,
            crawling or exploiting the web. I'm also responsible for the more boring stuff, like databases and object
            storage.
        </p>
        <h2>weapon of choice</h2>
        <p>
            Python 3. Why? Because it's the best language. Jokes aside, my objectives are to solve a problem as quickly
            as possible and build a working proof of concept.
            Since my code isn't meant to run on low-spec devices, I don't need to worry about making it as efficient as
            possible and can focus on the problem at hand.
            Furthermore, the community is huge, and you can find support for any problem you have.
        </p>
